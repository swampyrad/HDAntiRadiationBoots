# HDAntiRadiationBoots
An equipment addon for Hideous Destructor

Adds a set of protective boots to prevent damage from slime and lava floors.
They're less fragile than a Radsuit, but they leave you exposed to projectiles.
They're also kinda heavy, so don't expect to win any races with these on.

Bonus: Anti-Gravity Boots

Similar to the Anti-Radiation Boots, but painted in cherry red.
These boots allow the wearer to lower their gravity to jump across
large gaps, or get into hard-to-reach areas.
